{"name":"Sesquipedalian","tagline":"Qualcomm Hackathon 2013","body":"### Sesquipedalian\r\nThis app was developed for the 2013 Qualcomm Summer Intern Hackathon. It is a silly app. The user speaks into the phone and, after processing the audio, the app repeats a complicated and often confuddled version of the user's input. The idea came from a suggestion that people should be more precise. Instead of working towards that goal, we worked in perfect opposition to it.\r\n\r\n### Basic Overview\r\nGoogle voice regonition is used to convert audio into text. Then, the Stanford NLP Tagger is used to find the part of speech for every word. Using the word and the part of speech, we query an online thesaurus to fetch synonyms. Each word is replaced with the longest synonym. Lol. The answers range from nonsensical to hilarious. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJoe Maguire (@jmaguire), Site Mao (@distort3d), Kevin Jonaitis (@Kevin-Jonaitis), and Jim Rasche (@jjrasche).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nlol why","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
